Here is a challenge for you Dimitri build a fully functional Porfolio website. 

It needs to be responsive in design and mobile friendly as well. 
It should have links for your work, contact information, contact form, and links to other websites that you publish your works
It should be in a zip folder for comparison 
It should have a domain name and web ready
  Domain names can be free, usually prefer .tk since it gives your site somewhat of a more professional domain name. 
  Freenom is a great place to create an account and secure the domain name for your portfolio site. 
Use HTML5 and CSS3 standards
  Feel free to try to use Bootstrap if you can. 

Email me the zip folder and you should put a deadline on this project for one week. If you can feel free to contact me if you have
any questions.
